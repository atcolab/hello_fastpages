            "content": "Introduction . In today&#39;s blog post, we will look at how to work on image classification based problems using PyTorch and PyTorch-Image-Model. The example dataset we will be using today to train our model will be the Flower Classification TPUs dataset provided on Kaggle. . The aim of this post is to provide a training template so that it could be used for other image classification based problems. . Before we begin we first need to download the dataset from Kaggle. Once that is finished we&#39;ll need to download an additional dataset that handles some of the preprocessing for us. Next, we&#39;ll create an Image Dataset to process our images and labels so that we can neatly feed it into our PyTorch DataLoader. Finally, we&#39;ll create and train our model using PyTorch-Image-Model. . Flower Classification Overview . For this competition, users were asked to build an image classifier to classify 104 types of flowers. The following data description were given to us by Kaggle for this competition: . In this competition we&#39;re classifying 104 types of flowers based on their images drawn from five different public datasets. Some classes are very narrow, containing only a particular sub-type of flower (e.g. pink primroses) while other classes contain many sub-types (e.g. wild roses). . Gathering the Data . The data we will be using can be found here on Kaggle. . Once you&#39;ve downloaded the dataset simply unzip the file. . ! kaggle datasets download -d msheriey/104-flowers-garden-of-eden ! unzip 104-flowers-garden-of-eden.zip . Image Dataset . Before we dive into the Image Dataset let&#39;s briefly look at the train.csv file. . Our train.csv file consists of two columns - id and class. | The id column indicates where are images are located and the class column indicates what type of flower it is. | For example, a class with the label 1 indicates that the flower is a hard leaved pocket orchid. | . df = pd.read_csv(&#39;train.csv&#39;) df.head() . id class . 0 train/hard-leaved pocket orchid/11376.jpeg | 1 | . 1 train/hard-leaved pocket orchid/7037.jpeg | 1 | . 2 train/hard-leaved pocket orchid/8890.jpeg | 1 | . 3 train/hard-leaved pocket orchid/11168.jpeg | 1 | . 4 train/hard-leaved pocket orchid/7658.jpeg | 1 | . The objective of our Image Dataset is to take in the following information: . the df (dataframe) | the labels (class) | and our transformations which are optional | . Once we feed in the following information to our Image Dataset it will:&gt; - read-in each image row by row along with its respective label &gt; - perform transformations if given . and tranpose our array so we receive the following:DxWxH | . class FlowerDataset(Dataset): def __init__(self, df, labels, transforms=None): self.df = df self.labels = labels self.transforms = transforms def __len__(self): return len(self.df) def __getitem__(self, index): image_id = self.df[&#39;id&#39;].values[index] image_path = f&#39;./input/jpeg-224x224/{image_id}&#39; image = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR) image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) labels = self.labels.values[index] if self.transforms: augmented = self.transforms(image=image) image = augmented[&#39;image&#39;] image = image.astype(np.float32) image /= 255.0 image = image.transpose(2, 0, 1) return torch.tensor(image), torch.tensor(labels) . To keep things simple we will perform only the following transformation to our train set: . Horizontal Flip | Vertical Flip | Shift, Scale, and Rotate | . transforms_train = A.Compose([ A.HorizontalFlip(p=0.5), A.VerticalFlip(p=0.5), A.ShiftScaleRotate(shift_limit=0.0625, scale_limit=0.2, rotate_limit=15, p=0.9, border_mode=cv2.BORDER_REFLECT) ]) transforms_valid = A.Compose([ ]) . Let&#39;s load the first 1000 rows of our dataframe into our Image Dataset along with the train transformations. Next let&#39;s pass in our train_ds into our show_images function to visualize some sample images. . train_ds = FlowerDataset(df[:1000], df[:1000][&#39;class&#39;],transforms=transforms_train) def show_images(ds): rcParams[&#39;figure.figsize&#39;] = 20, 10 for i in range(2): f, axarr = plt.subplots(1, 5) for p in range(5): idx = np.random.randint(0, len(ds)) img, label = ds[idx] axarr[p].imshow(img.transpose(0,1).transpose(1, 2)) show_images(train_ds) . Model . To create our model, we will be using the &quot;vit_base_patch16_224&quot; pretrained model from PyTorch-Image-Model library . model = timm.create_model(&#39;vit_base_patch16_224&#39;, pretrained=True) . Once we have finished downloaded the pretrained model we&#39;ll make some minor adjustments so that we can use it to train our own classifier. Since we are trying to classify 104 flower species we need to change the out_features of the head of our model to 104. . class VisionTransformer(nn.Module): def __init__(self, model=model): super(VisionTransformer, self).__init__() self.base_model = model self.base_model.head = nn.Linear(768, 104) def forward(self, x): x = self.base_model(x) return x . Training and Validation . Here we&#39;ve created our train loop function and valid loop function. . Each function iterates through the dataloader to grab the images and labels. | Then they pass the images into our model to make the predictions. | Once we have the predictions we pass it along with the labels into our loss function to calculate the loss. | We will also pass in the predictions and labels into our metrics.accuracy_score function to calculate the acccuracy. | . def train_fn(model, loader, optimizer, loss_fn, device): model.train() avg_train_loss = 0.0 train_accuracy = 0.0 preds = [] labels = [] for step, (data, targets) in enumerate(loader): data = data.to(device, dtype=torch.float) targets = targets.to(device, dtype=torch.long) optimizer.zero_grad() outputs = model(data) loss = loss_fn(outputs, targets) avg_train_loss += loss.item() / len(loader) with amp.scale_loss(loss, optimizer) as scaled_loss: scaled_loss.backward() if ((step + 1) % 1 == 0) or ((step + 1) == len(loader)): optimizer.step() preds.append(outputs.argmax(1).detach().cpu().numpy()) labels.append(targets.detach().cpu().numpy()) preds = np.concatenate(preds) labels = np.concatenate(labels) train_accuracy = metrics.accuracy_score(preds, labels) return avg_train_loss, train_accuracy def valid_fn(model, loader, loss_fn, device): model.eval() avg_val_loss = 0.0 val_accuracy = 0.0 preds = [] labels = [] with torch.no_grad(): for step, (data, targets) in enumerate(loader): data = data.to(device, dtype=torch.float) targets = targets.to(device, dtype=torch.long) outputs = model(data) loss = loss_fn(outputs, targets) avg_val_loss += loss.item() / len(loader) preds.append(outputs.argmax(1).detach().cpu().numpy()) labels.append(targets.detach().cpu().numpy()) preds = np.concatenate(preds) labels = np.concatenate(labels) val_accuracy = metrics.accuracy_score(preds, labels) return avg_val_loss, val_accuracy . Cross Validation . For this example, we will be using StratifiedKFold for our cross validation scheme. . skf = model_selection.StratifiedKFold(4, shuffle=True, random_state=42) folds = df.copy() folds[&#39;fold&#39;] = -1 for i, (train_idx, valid_idx) in enumerate(skf.split(folds, folds[&#39;class&#39;])): folds.loc[valid_idx, &#39;fold&#39;] = i folds.head() . id class fold . 0 train/hard-leaved pocket orchid/11376.jpeg | 1 | 1 | . 1 train/hard-leaved pocket orchid/7037.jpeg | 1 | 2 | . 2 train/hard-leaved pocket orchid/8890.jpeg | 1 | 0 | . 3 train/hard-leaved pocket orchid/11168.jpeg | 1 | 3 | . 4 train/hard-leaved pocket orchid/7658.jpeg | 1 | 1 | . Running Our Model . Now that we have almost everything in place all we have to do is fill in some minor details to have our model running. For this example, we&#39;ll be running our model using only 1-fold, but this can be easily changed to run all 4-folds. Depending on which fold we use, our training and validation sets will be split up differently. Once we have our training and validation sets we&#39;ll feed them into our Image Dataset and then into the PyTorch DataLoader. . Next we&#39;ll tell our model the following: . the number of epochs we want to run | which model we want to use | which optimizer want to use | which scheduler we want to use | and our loss function | . After this is completed we can now finally run our model. . for fold in range(1): N_FOLDS = 1 print(f&quot;Fold: {fold+1} / {N_FOLDS}&quot;) train_idx = np.where((folds[&#39;fold&#39;] != fold))[0] valid_idx = np.where((folds[&#39;fold&#39;] == fold))[0] df_this = folds.loc[train_idx] df_valid = folds.loc[valid_idx] train_ds = FlowerDataset(df_this, df_this[&#39;class&#39;], transforms_train) valid_ds = FlowerDataset(df_valid, df_valid[&#39;class&#39;],transforms_valid) train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader( train_ds, batch_size=64, shuffle=True, num_workers=4, drop_last=True ) valid_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader( valid_ds, batch_size=64, shuffle=False, num_workers=4, drop_last=False ) NUM_EPOCHS = 10 device = torch.device(&#39;cuda&#39; if torch.cuda.is_available() else &#39;cpu&#39;) model = VisionTransformer().to(device) optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4) model, optimizer = amp.initialize(model, optimizer, opt_level=&quot;O1&quot;) scheduler = CosineAnnealingLR(optimizer, NUM_EPOCHS) loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() loss_history = { &quot;train&quot;: [], &quot;valid&quot;: [] } acc_history = { &quot;train&quot;: [], &quot;valid&quot;: [] } for epoch in range(NUM_EPOCHS): running_train_loss, train_accuracy = train_fn(model=model, loader=train_loader, optimizer=optimizer, loss_fn=loss_fn, device=device) scheduler.step(epoch-1) loss_history[&#39;train&#39;].append(running_train_loss) acc_history[&#39;train&#39;].append(train_accuracy) running_val_loss, val_accuracy = valid_fn(model=model, loader=valid_loader, loss_fn=loss_fn, device=device) loss_history[&#39;valid&#39;].append(running_val_loss) acc_history[&#39;valid&#39;].append(val_accuracy) print(f&quot;Epoch: {epoch+1} | lr: {optimizer.param_groups[0][&#39;lr&#39;]:.7f} | train loss: {running_train_loss:.2f} | valid loss: {running_val_loss:.2f} | train accuracy: {train_accuracy:.2f} | valid accuracy: {val_accuracy:.2f}&quot;) .

Let&#39;s extract the label column and create a target variable to hold the label column. Because we only extracted the label column our target variable should hold one column with all 42000 rows. . target = mnist_train[&#39;label&#39;].astype(int) print(target.shape) . . (42000,) . Let&#39;s create an images variable to hold all of our pixel values from pixel0 to pixel783. Before this we need to drop the label column from our mnist_train dataframe.

Let&#39;s print the shape of our new images dataframe. Because we only dropped the labels column our new dataframe is now size (42000, 784). We simply dropped one column so 785 -&gt; 784. . images_np = images.to_numpy() images_np.shape . . (42000, 784) . In order to plot an image of a number from our dataframe we first need to reshape it. We&#39;re reminded that the mnist dataset contains pixel values of the numbers 0-9. The width and height of the images are 28x28. That is why we have 784 columns because if you were to multiply 28x28 we would get 784. . The code below reshape our images dataframe so that (42000, 784) -&gt; (42000, 28, 28). We can confirm this by printing its shape. . images_np_reshape = images_np.reshape(-1, 28, 28) print(images_np_reshape.shape) . . (42000, 28, 28) . Nows lets grab the first number in our dataframe which is 1. Look at the original mnist dataframe and check the label value for the first row. Since we reshaped our dataframe instead of 784 we get (28, 28). . images_np_reshape[0].shape . . (28, 28) . We use plt.imshow to plot our number The parameter cmap=&#39;gray&#39; just turns our image into black and white. . plt.imshow(images_np_reshape[0], cmap=&#39;gray&#39;) . . &lt;matplotlib.image.AxesImage at 0x120815b90&gt; . Without cmap=&#39;gray&#39; we would get something like this. . plt.imshow(images_np_reshape[0]) . . &lt;matplotlib.image.AxesImage at 0x1223d2f90&gt; .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
