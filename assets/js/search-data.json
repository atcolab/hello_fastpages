Let&#39;s extract the label column and create a target variable to hold the label column. Because we only extracted the label column our target variable should hold one column with all 42000 rows. . target = mnist_train[&#39;label&#39;].astype(int) print(target.shape) . . (42000,) . Let&#39;s create an images variable to hold all of our pixel values from pixel0 to pixel783. Before this we need to drop the label column from our mnist_train dataframe. Let&#39;s print the first five rows of our new images dataframe. . images = mnist_train.drop(&#39;label&#39;, axis=1) images.head() . . pixel0 pixel1 pixel2 pixel3 pixel4 pixel5 pixel6 pixel7 pixel8 pixel9 ... pixel774 pixel775 pixel776 pixel777 pixel778 pixel779 pixel780 pixel781 pixel782 pixel783 . 0 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ... | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | . 1 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ... | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | . 2 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ... | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | . 3 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ... | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | . 4 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ... | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | . 5 rows × 784 columns . Let&#39;s print the shape of our new images dataframe. Because we only dropped the labels column our new dataframe is now size (42000, 784). We simply dropped one column so 785 -&gt; 784. . images_np = images.to_numpy() images_np.shape . . (42000, 784) . In order to plot an image of a number from our dataframe we first need to reshape it. We&#39;re reminded that the mnist dataset contains pixel values of the numbers 0-9. The width and height of the images are 28x28. That is why we have 784 columns because if you were to multiply 28x28 we would get 784. . The code below reshape our images dataframe so that (42000, 784) -&gt; (42000, 28, 28). We can confirm this by printing its shape. . images_np_reshape = images_np.reshape(-1, 28, 28) print(images_np_reshape.shape) . . (42000, 28, 28) . Nows lets grab the first number in our dataframe which is 1. Look at the original mnist dataframe and check the label value for the first row. Since we reshaped our dataframe instead of 784 we get (28, 28). . images_np_reshape[0].shape . . (28, 28) . We use plt.imshow to plot our number The parameter cmap=&#39;gray&#39; just turns our image into black and white. . plt.imshow(images_np_reshape[0], cmap=&#39;gray&#39;) . . &lt;matplotlib.image.AxesImage at 0x120815b90&gt; . Without cmap=&#39;gray&#39; we would get something like this. . plt.imshow(images_np_reshape[0]) . . &lt;matplotlib.image.AxesImage at 0x1223d2f90&gt; .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
